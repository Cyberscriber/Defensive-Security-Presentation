<h1>Defensive Security Presentation</h1>

 

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I played the role of a SOC analyst at a fictional organization called Virtual Space Industries (VSI).  VSI has heard rumors that a competitor, JobeCorp, may launch cyberattacks to disrupt VSIâ€™s business. I was tasked with using Splunk to monitor against potential attacks on our systems and applications.  My networking team has also provided me with past logs to help me develop baselines and create reports, alerts, and dashboards to protect VSI from any attacks by JobeCorp.  Objectives:  
- Analyze the reports and dashboards in order to determine whether defensive choices protected VSI from these attacks
- Determine how well or poorly the defensive solution alerted and protected against the simulated attacks
- Communicate any adjustments I would make to my defensive solution
